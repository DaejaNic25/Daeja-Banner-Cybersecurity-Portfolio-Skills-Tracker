# 🔐 Manage Authorization with Linux Permissions

**Platform:** Coursera – Google Cybersecurity Certificate
**Skill Level:** Introductory
**Estimated Time:** ~1 hour

---

## 🧠 Overview

This lab focuses on configuring and managing authorization in a Linux environment. Authorization ensures that only approved users can access or modify files and directories. As a security analyst, properly managing file permissions is critical to protecting sensitive information and preventing unauthorized access.

---

## 🎯 Scenario

In this activity, I examined and modified file and directory permissions within the `/home/researcher2/projects` directory. The `researcher2` user belongs to the `research_team` group, and permissions needed to be reviewed and corrected to align with proper security standards.

The objectives included:

* Reviewing permissions of files and hidden files
* Removing unauthorized write access
* Restricting access to sensitive files
* Modifying directory permissions to limit execution access

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Commands Used

* `cd`
* `ls -l`
* `ls -la`
* `chmod`

---

## 📝 Task Breakdown & Evidence

---

## 🔹 Task 1: Check File and Directory Details

**Objective:**
Review permissions for all files (including hidden files) inside the `projects` directory.

**Commands Used:**

```bash
cd projects
ls -l
ls -la
```

**Evidence:**

![List file permissions](images/Picture2.png)
![Check for hidden files](images/Picture3.png)

**Security Relevance:**
Reviewing permissions ensures that unauthorized users do not have access to sensitive project files.

---

## 🔹 Task 2: Change File Permissions

**Objective:**
Remove write access for "other" users and restrict access to sensitive files.

**Commands Used:**

```bash
chmod o-w filename
chmod g-rw project_m.txt
ls -l
```

**Evidence:**

![Identify incorrect permissions](images/Picture4.png)
![Remove write permission for other](images/Picture5.png)
![Restrict group permissions on project\_m.txt](images/Picture6.png)
![Confirm updated permissions](images/Picture7.png)

**Security Relevance:**
Restricting write permissions prevents unauthorized modification of files and protects integrity.

---

## 🔹 Task 3: Modify Hidden File Permissions

**Objective:**
Ensure `.project_x.txt` is read-only for user and group.

**Commands Used:**

```bash
ls -la
chmod ug-w .project_x.txt
ls -l .project_x.txt
```

**Evidence:**

![View hidden file permissions](images/Picture8.png)
![Modify hidden file permissions](images/Picture9.png)
![Confirm updated hidden file permissions](images/Picture10.png)

**Security Relevance:**
Hidden files often contain archived or configuration data. Ensuring they are read-only protects against accidental or malicious edits.

---

## 🔹 Task 4: Change Directory Permissions

**Objective:**
Restrict access to the `drafts` directory so only `researcher2` has execute access.

**Commands Used:**

```bash
ls -ld drafts
chmod g-x drafts
ls -ld drafts
```

**Evidence:**

![Check drafts directory permissions](images/Picture11.png)
![Remove group execute permission](images/Picture12.png)

**Security Relevance:**
Removing execute permissions from the group prevents unauthorized users from accessing or traversing sensitive directories.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Proper permission management protects system integrity
* Removing unnecessary write access reduces risk of file tampering
* Hidden files require the same level of security review as visible files
* Directory execute permissions control user access to folder contents

---

## 📌 Skills Demonstrated

* Linux permission analysis
* Access control enforcement
* Secure configuration management
* Principle of least privilege implementation
